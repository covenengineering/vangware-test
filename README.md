âœ… Equality test with enforced legibility (based on [RITEway][riteway] and inspired by [uvu](https://github.com/lukeed/uvu)).

## Usage

Write:

```typescript
import { suite } from "@vangware/test";

const add = (addend2: number) => (addend1: number) => addend1 + addend2;

export default suite([
	{
		given: "a 1 and a 2",
		must: "return 3",
		received: add(2)(1),
		wanted: 3
	},
	{
		given: "a 1 and a -2",
		must: "return -1",
		received: add(-2)(1),
		wanted: -1
	}
])("Example suite name (optional)");
```

Then run:

```bash
@vangware/test
```

If let's say the first test fails, the error reads something like this:

```text
[FAIL] Example suite name (optional)

> Given a 1 and a 2, must return 3.

Received: 4
Wanted:   3
```
